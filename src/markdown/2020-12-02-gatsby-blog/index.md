Ever thought of giving a static website generator a try? So have I!

During this pandemic period, it crossed my mind to shape my digital presence with a blog.
Through this blog, I can complement my career path outlined on my LinkedIn profile, with my professional activities outside of work.

To spice things up a bit, I've went out of my comfort zone and jumped into GatsbyJS with TailwindCSS (I haven't worked with ReactJS, nor GraphQL before).
On top of that, I've set up a Netlify CI pipeline for deploys and hooked Yandex Metrika for monitoring.

There is plenty of room for improvements, however I've settled for this MVP. I'll definitely develop it further in time (tag filtering, SEO, a11y, etc).

Meanwhile "Old Sport", you can check the source code [here](https://github.com/razvan-rosu/personal-website), be it for inspiration, or a GraphQL query!
