I've held my first lightning talk at Frontend Bucharest Meetup on Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology.

The meetup was recorded, so you can see and hear me stutter [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_VOwB3BqYo).

The slides aren't quite visible in the recording, so you can follow along [here](https://www.slideshare.net/RazvanRosu2/atomic-design-razvan-rosu/).
