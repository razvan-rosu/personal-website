Back in 2019, I've published an article on Medium: [Planning, designing and developing design systems](https://uxdesign.cc/design-systems-4baa50172c5d).
It was a T-shaped article, in which I've showcased the potential of a Design System and provided an in depth view of it's composition: Style Guide, Component Library and Rules.

Time has passed.

Let's put theory into practice by implementig a Style Guide and a Component Library.
The [A.D.C.E.S. meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bucharest-a-d-c-e-s-meetup/events/291452753/) community received me with open arms for such a talk.

This presentation deserves to be converted into a 2nd Medium article, TBA!
