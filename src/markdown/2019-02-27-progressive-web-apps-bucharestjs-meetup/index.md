I've held a 20 minutes talk at BucharestJS Meetup, showcasing the current state of Progressive Web Apps at that time.
The presentation's demo was based on a LitHTML + LitElement technologies.

The slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rzvnrosu/progressive-web-apps-with-lithtml-bucharestjs-meetup).
