The topic of Design Systems always had my curiosity. 
Throughout 2019 I've deep dived into this subject.
After gathering my research notes, I've noticed that the outcome was too long for a presentation.
Still, I've wanted to share my findings with other developers and designers. 
That's how I ended up writing my first article on Medium.com. 
To my surprise, UX Collective aka UXdesign.cc appreciated my work and helped me republish it under their wing.
