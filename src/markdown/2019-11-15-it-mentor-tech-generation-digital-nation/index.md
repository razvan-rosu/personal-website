Tech Generation is a project developed by Digital Nation, a non-profit organization supported by the Ministry of National Education of Romania and Google LLC.

The programme aims at teenagers helping them acquire the digital skills required on the labor market.
It is entirely online, with few events located on site in the following cities: Alba Iulia, Oradea and Piatra Neam»õ.

As an IT mentor, I've led 2x Learn to Code classes (from november 2019 to august 2020 and august-december 2020). I have introduced knowledge-thirsty explorers into the world of web development through the lenses of Front-End technologies and the popular WordPress CMS.
In between the two series, I've coached two small teams through their first real project.
