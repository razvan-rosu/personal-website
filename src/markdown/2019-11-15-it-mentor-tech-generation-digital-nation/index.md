Tech Generation is a project developed by Digital Nation, funded by Google LLC and backed by the Ministry of National Education of Romania.

The programme aims at young people helping them acquire the digital skills required on the labor market.
It is entirely online, with few events located on site in the following cities: Alba Iulia, Oradea and Piatra Neam»õ.

As an IT mentor, I've led two Learn to Code classes (from november 2019 to august 2020 and from august 2020 to december 2020) by introducing them into the world of web development through the lenses of Front-End technologies and backed by the popular WordPress CMS.
Further still, I've coached two small teams through their first project.
