PepinTeen is a project developed by ING Tech Romania in partnership with Școala de Valori. 
The programme was designed as a blended learning opportunity of IT knowledge with soft skills with the sole purpose of giving teens a boost in their career paths.
It spanned from September 2018 to June 2019, in 3 romanian cities: Bucharest, Giurgiu and Pucioasa, reaching a total of 150 curious teenagers.

As a technical trainer, I’ve contributed to several whole day IT presentations and workshops. 
To top it off, I’ve coached one talented teenager in a one-on-one manner at the end of the programme.
