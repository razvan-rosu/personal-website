I've held a lightning talk at Frontend Bucharest Meetup, based on a personal case study on decreasing webpages load speed.

The meetup was recorded, so you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc61DNtECr4).

The slides aren't quite visible in the recording, so you can follow along [here](https://www.slideshare.net/RazvanRosu2/web-optimizations-back-to-the-basics-razvan-rosu).
