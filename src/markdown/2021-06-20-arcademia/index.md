The 2021 edition of PepinTEEN is called Arcademia, backed once more by ING Tech and Școala de Valori.
This time, it focuses on teachers instead of students.

The Coronavirus pandemic took the world by storm and the educational system along with it.
Arcademia comes to teachers' aid by exposing and training them in creative teaching techniques.

I've co-held a 1-day workshop with [Dragoș Apostu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dragosapostu/) on Digital Integration. 
Together with 35 teachers across Romania, we have tackeled the changes brought by the pandemic, looked into the ways of learning (traditional, online and hybrid) and wrapped up with a demo on the Google Suite.
