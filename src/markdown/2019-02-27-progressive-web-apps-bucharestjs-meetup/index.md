I've held a full talk at [BucharestJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/bucharestjs/events/257755762), showcasing the current state of Progressive Web Apps at the time.
The presentation's demo was based on LitHTML and LitElement technologies.

The slides are available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/rzvnrosu/progressive-web-apps-with-lithtml-bucharestjs-meetup).
